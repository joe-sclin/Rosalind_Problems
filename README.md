# Rosalind_Problems

**Rosalind** is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving.

This repository is for these interesting practices of basic python skills to solve [Rosalind Problems](https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/)

Although there are many modules available to reduce works needed, as least as possible module were imported to solve problems in order to more focused on the basic build-in functions in Python.

In genral, module argparse is used to include the corresponding dataset txt file as arguments for most of problems, for example:
```python 01.py Problem_01_Dataset.txt```
Simple dataset are input as program argument, for example input of 3 program argument:
```python 01.py 1 2 3```
